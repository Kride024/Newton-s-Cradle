<h1>Newton's Cradle Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Newton's Cradle is a classic physics demonstration that showcases the principles of conservation of momentum and energy transfer. This project simulates the iconic cradle using [programming language/technology], allowing users to explore the fascinating world of physics.

Features

- Simulates Newton's Cradle with realistic physics
- Adjustable parameters: ball mass, velocity, and spacing
- Visualizes energy transfer and momentum conservation
- Interactive: pause, resume, and reset simulation
